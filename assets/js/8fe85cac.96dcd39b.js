The attacker's gain may be reduced mainly for two reasons. One is the loss caused by the collapse of the token value after a successful attack; the other is the community may reach a consensus to roll back the state through a hard fork to eliminate the attacker's gain.

This requires increasing the total mining revenue of Conflux to a level comparable to that of Ethereum. The current mining issuance of Ethereum is about 2.6 ETH every 13 seconds, or an average of 0.2 ETH per second. Based on the market price of 3400 USD/ETH, that gives Ethereum a mining revenue of about 680 USD per second, or about 58,752,000 USD per day. To raise Conflux's mining revenue to this level, it would require a boost of about 170 times. This means increasing the revenue of each block to $340,\xa0 that is, increasing the reward per block to over 340 CFX while maintaining the price of 1USD/CFX, or increasing the unit price of CFX by 170 times while maintaining the output.

For this reason, adding PoS finality decisions to Conflux's existing PoW consensus mechanism to improve confirmation speed and resist potential 51% attacks is in line with Conflux's goals.
