It should be noted that the key in the blockchain is generally 256bits long and the value It is also 256bits long (each is 32B long, and the total is 64B long). The deposit required for storage is proportional to the minimum multiple of 64B that can cover all stored items. For each storage entry, the last account that writes to the entry is called the owner of the storage entry. If a storage item is written during the execution of contract C, and a guarantor provides guarantee for it, then C is regarded as the writer of the item and accordingly becomes the owner of the item (see section 7.1 for details). In the world state, during the entire life cycle of a storage item, the owner of the item must lock a fixed amount of CFX as a storage deposit for the storage space. Specifically, for each storage entry with a size of 64B, its owner will be locked by 1/16CFX.
