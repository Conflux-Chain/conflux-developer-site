Conflux has tools that can help developers quickly build a dapp.

## [Conflux-Truffle](https://github.com/Conflux-Chain/conflux-truffle)
Truffle is a world class development environment, testing framework and asset pipeline for blockchains using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), aiming to make life as a developer easier. We have ported it to Conflux-Truffle, which will work with the Conflux network and will have the same features and usage experience.

To find out how to use it, you can read [Truffle's documentation](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/overview).
And `conflux-truffle`'s [setup guide](https://github.com/Conflux-Chain/conflux-truffle/blob/conflux/ultimate-guide.md)

## [Conflux Studio](https://github.com/ObsidianLabs/ConfluxStudio)
Conflux Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE), making developing Conflux smart contracts faster and easier, developed by [ObsidianLabs](https://www.obsidians.io/).

You can find its documentation in [readme](https://github.com/ObsidianLabs/ConfluxStudio), and there is also a [tutorial](https://github.com/ObsidianLabs/conflux-dapp-tutorial) about how to use it to develop a Dapp.
