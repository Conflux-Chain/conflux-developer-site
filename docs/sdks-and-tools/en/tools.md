Conflux has tools that can help developers quickly build a dapp.

## [Conflux-Truffle](https://github.com/Conflux-Chain/conflux-truffle)

Truffle is a world class development environment, testing framework and asset pipeline for blockchains using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), aiming to make life as a developer easier. We have ported it to Conflux-Truffle, which will work with the Conflux network and will have the same features and usage experience.

To find out how to use it, you can read [Truffle's documentation](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/overview).
And `conflux-truffle`'s [setup guide](https://github.com/Conflux-Chain/conflux-truffle/blob/conflux/ultimate-guide.md)
