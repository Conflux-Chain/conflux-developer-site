# How to Use CFX Faucet
Want to play with Conflux but don't have any CFX ? You can apply to get some **testnet** CFX on Conflux Faucet.

## Create Account with [ConfluxPortal](https://portal.conflux-chain.org/)
An Conflux account is needed to apply testnet `CFX`, which can be created by ConfluxPortal. Portal is an browser extension wallet, just like Ethereum's MetaMask.
Both `Chrome` and `Firefox` is supported. User can search and install it at browser's [extension marketplace](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/confluxportal/opafkgfpaamecojfkaialabagfofilmg).

The first step after portal installation is create new `12 word seed phase`, which is very important, can be used to generate or recovery accounts. Which means the seed phase should been keep carefully.
